Careful planning of the structure of the HTML can assist with identifying selectors in both CSS and Javascript.  How do you think the structure of ttt3 helps or does not help with that goal?

I think the structure of ttt3 being separated out into HTML, CSS, and Java help to keep everything organized and easy to read on one page, though if the file eventually becomes very long, it may be hard to identify Js within it and thus make editing more of a hassle. Other components like using divs and ids help with styling.

After reviewing the class notes, instructions, and some online coding resources, I've reworked the code from last week that was faulty and changed the way it's done. I have X appearing on each click, not sure if we needed to have O appear after X? Please let me know if this is acceptable.
