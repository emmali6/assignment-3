Careful planning of the structure of the HTML can assist with identifying selectors in both CSS and Javascript.  How do you think the structure of ttt3 helps or does not help with that goal?

I think the structure of ttt3 being separated out into HTML, CSS, and Java help to keep everything organized and easy to read on one page, though if the file eventually becomes very long, it may be hard to identify Js within it and thus make editing more of a hassle. Other components like using divs and ids help with styling.
